## Recommendations

- Strong's should stay labeled as starter data until a full rights-safe dataset is imported, reviewed, mapped, and validated.
- TSK is still sample/reviewed coverage, not a full TSK import. Build the next reviewed batches from the weakest-book table.
- Webster is large enough to be useful, but OCR quality remains the main cleanup need. Favor reviewed entries first in user-facing displays.
- Continue commentary expansion by thinnest books first rather than by raw count.
- Public-domain audio should be piloted through the media intake workflow before becoming public.
